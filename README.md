## Description
A text editor that runs in the browser that will be a single-page application and will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Installation
There are two ways a user can use this application.<br>
The first way is by cloning the repository on to their local machine of choice.<br>
The user will then head on to their code editor of choice and open the terminal and type the following `npm i` to install all of the dependencies. <br>
Once this step is done, the user will then type `npm run start` to initialize and build the server. The user will then be able to open the application into a web browser and type `http://localhost:3000/` in to the address bar. <br>
The other way a user can use this application is by going to the following link `https://lovely-jate-2fa379ab8708.herokuapp.com/` and download the application into their desktop in order for the user to use it locally.

## Usage
